            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <head>A Letter to a Friend concerning the late Anſwers to a Letter to the Diſſenter.</head>
            <opener>
               <salute>Dear Sir,</salute>
            </opener>
            <p>YOU have infinitely obliged me in ſending the ſeveral Anſwers to the Letter to the Diſſenter: For notwithſtanding the many Reflections upon the Church of <hi>England</hi> which I find there, yet I cannot but heartily laugh to obſerve how afraid ſome people are leſt the Diſſenters, thoſe eſpecially who have moſt Money as well as Underſtanding ſhould like that better, and be a little aware how they are made Tools to do miſchief both to themſelves and others. But that which pleaſeth me moſt of all is to find that thoſe two Incomperable Worthies Sir <hi>R. L. S.</hi> and <hi>H. C.</hi> whoſe former writings had like to have ſet the people together by the Ears, do now lovingly accord together to the Satisfaction of the whole Nation, and notwithſtanding their former Fewds and Bicker<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ings can now write both on the ſame ſide.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Nor do I ſee any ſuch neceſſary contrariety between Infallibility and Liberty,</hi> ſaith H. C. p. 11. <hi>Why then this Liberty and Infallibility truly underſtood and rightly diſtinguiſhed may very well ſtand together; and the holding the one Opinion does not at all claſh with permitting the Exerciſe of the other;</hi> ſaith Sir R. L. S. p. 7.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Whereas we ſee many many places where both Papiſts and Proteſtants live very quietly together,</hi> ſaith H. C. p. 3. <hi>To ſay nothing of the freedom they are allowed in divers places where they live in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>termixt,</hi> ſaith Sir R. p. 10. <hi>There is a great difference,</hi> quoth H. C. p 29. <hi>between repealing a Law, and relaxing or diſpencing with the Penalty. The firſt can only be done in Parliament, the latter has been always adjudged to be part of the Royal Prerogative. The King,</hi> quoth Sir R. <hi>ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pends by his Prerogative, but a Total Repeal muſt be the work of his Majeſty in Parliament, which does not yet hinder the Temporary Virtue of a Temporary Suſpenſion.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>When I conſider theſe and the like Paſſages, wherein our two Patriots to the welfare of the Publick do now ſo happily agree; I could not at firſt keep out of my mind a fooliſh Suſpenſion, that theſe Gentlemen were certainly two of the <hi>Mediators of the new Alliance,</hi> which the Letter to the Diſſenter makes mention of, and that all their former Jangling was only in Jeſt and by Agreement. And, to tell you all, the temptation was very ſtrong up<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>on me for a while, to believe that beſides the common work which they were both imploy<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ed about, they meant nothing elſe by their pretended Quarrel, then to obtain ſome modeſt Allowances for their neceſſary Occaſions, the one from the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther from the Diſſenters. But I ſoon blamed my ſelf for ſuſpecting that Men of their Inte<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>grity and Fortunes could ever be perſwaded to condeſcend to ſo mean, not to ſay ſo unwor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy an Undertaking.</p>
            <p>At laſt conſulting Sir <hi>R.</hi> about it, I found him to have ſalved the Difficulty, <hi>p.</hi> 12. where he tells, that <hi>according to a change of Circumſtances, a Man of Principles may vary his Judgment with a reſpect to</hi> Hic <hi>and</hi> Nunc, <hi>as to ſome particular:</hi> and conſequently that in how great E<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſteem ſoever they may have formerly been there may be a time, wherein one Book called <hi>Tolleration Diſcus'd</hi> may be of no uſe at all, and another called the <hi>Pacquets of Advice</hi> ſhall be quite out of Seaſon. For <hi>Then was Then, and Now is Now.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>But whatever may have cauſed this Alteration, which happens to appear in theſe Gentle<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mens Writings; it gives me occaſion to be very merry ſometimes, with ſome of their won<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted Admirers: For whenever I get ſome of my Tory Parſons neer me. Behold, cry I, your <hi>Obſervator</hi> pleading for Liberty of Conſcience, and for Accomodations; does not this de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerve a ſecond contrebution?—And no ſooner are they gave, and ſome of the <hi>Non-Cons</hi> (with whom I am acquainted) come to make a Viſit, but I preſently fetch out <hi>H. C</hi>'s An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſwer. Look you Gentlemen, ſay I, the Papiſts are not ſuch cruel people as you imagined, and you were baſely abuſed in the <hi>Weekly Advices</hi> which you were wont to receive from <hi>Rome.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Both Parties ſcratch their Heads upon this Occaſion, and ſome endeavour to defend their Writings; but others ſwear they will never truſt any of theſe mercenary Scriblers for the future.</p>
            <p>But the beſt of all is this, that notwithſtanding this ſtrong Confederacy of theſe mighty Men againſt a poor ſingle Letter; they are not agreed of what ſort of Kidney he is who wrote it.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>H. C.</hi> will have him to be an highflown perſecuting Church of <hi>England</hi> Man; but Sir <hi>R.</hi> inſinuates p. 26. as if he were a Diſſenter, or at leaſt a Diſſenters Fellow.</p>
            <pb n="2" facs="tcp:105774:2"/>

               </gap> be he who he will it is both their Opinions, that his Deſign is nothing but to ſtir up Fears and Jealouſies, and therefore that it is as much as the Diſſenters Lives are worth to mind one word what he ſaith to them.</p>
            <p>Now <gap reason="illegible" resp="#UOM" extent="2 letters">
                  <desc>••</desc>
               </gap>a Writer be what he will, when ſo much Pains is taken, and by ſuch different Tools, to bring about what it ſeem; that Letter would abſtruct: were I a Diſſenter, I ſhould be a little tempted to conſider the Purport of it. And if ſo many Thouſands thereof have, as Sir <hi>R.</hi> aſſerts, been ſold, the Printer is moſt of all beholden to the Number as well as the dulneſs of the Anſwers to it.</p>
            <p>But certainly <hi>R.</hi> is moſt of all to be blamed in refeference to the ſpreading of it; for he has cauſed it to be Printed almoſt intire, as well as added a foit to ſet it off.</p>
            <p>I ſuppoſe I ſhall be accounted at leaſt a Trimmer for talking at this rate. But one would think that according to Sir. <hi>R</hi>'s meaning of that word (who makes a Trimmer to be one who is always ready to change with the Times) he himſelf was much more ſo: For his Judg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment it ſeeme can alter <hi>pro hic nune:</hi> and notwithſtanding for three whole Volumes of Ob<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſervators, who at laſt ſo kind as he and a Diſſenter?</p>
            <p>
               <hi>And why may not my Anſwer be Addreſſed to a Diſſenter too, p.</hi> 2. Ay why not to a Diſſenter? my old dearly beloved Diſſenter? And then as if he would hug him to Death at parting he concludes, <hi>dear Sir, your moſt affectionate humble Servant.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>As for the other meaning of the word Trimmer, whereby I always underſtood one that was for making the Terms of Commanion as eaſie as he could, and for allowing ſuch a Li<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>berty as might be conſiſtent with the publick Safety; I care not who thinks me ſuch a one. And although I do not pretend to promiſe any thing in the behalf of others, yet I am apt to believe that many of our beſt Divines both are and have all along been of the ſame Mind, and had it not been for Men of ſuch a temper as Sir <hi>R. I. S.</hi> and <hi>H. C.</hi> and the College in a certain place beyond the Seas for the propagating that Faith; things had tended that way long before now.</p>
            <p>Is it not pleaſant to obſerve that in the very ſame Paper one of theſe ſhould be able to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tect a Conſpiracy of Common-wealths Men; and the other a Plot both of the Latitudinarian Divines and high-flown Church-men; That the one ſhould find fault with the Author thereof for his Moderation, as being therefore no Genuine Son of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> and the other inſinuate as if no moderation were intended: and becauſe his wonted Clamor <hi>No Po<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pery, No Arbitrary Government,</hi> will now take, ſtretches his Throat with bawling <hi>No Perſecu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, No Perſecution.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>I meddle not with the ſubject matter of the preſent debate, the <hi>Tegs</hi> and <hi>penal Laws,</hi> but I could be glad to have none of us mind what the <hi>Knaves</hi> and the <hi>Beg<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gars</hi> ſay concerning them. For theſe alway wreſt every thing to the worſt ſenſe, widen the Breaches, which honeſt Men endeavour to cloſe, and are not ſo much concerned for Truth, as what they can get moſt Money for Writing.</p>
            <p>For the reſt of the Anſwers to the Letter which you ſent me, we are very much behol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>den to the Authors, for diſcovering the many undoubted Characters who they are, for they are neither colouging Diſſenters as <hi>H. C.</hi> is, nor half faced Church of <hi>England</hi> Proteſtants, as is Sir <hi>R.</hi> but downright honeſt Papiſts. This ſame Letter thought I has brought good Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany together.</p>
            <p>As to the <hi>Diſſenters,</hi> notwithſtanding this noiſe about Perſecution; I hope they will be ſo wiſe as to conſider from whence the orders about it came from time to time: and likewiſe what were the times and ſeaſons when it was moſt ſet on foot, that for ſecret reaſons they have had their worſe and their better days, as if they had been one while ſwinged off to ſowre them ngainſt the Church, and another while ſtroaked that they might live to remem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber it: Laſtly, that when any of the Church Party talked on the ſevere ſide, the reaſon of that was no ſecret. Whilſt Polling at <hi>Guildhall</hi> for ſuch as had once overturn'd the Govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, it could not be expected but that it ſhould give occaſion to ſome who were zealouſly concern'd for the preſent Eſtabliſhment, and for the welfare both of his preſent and late Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſty, to be more hot againſt them than otherwiſe they would have been.</p>
            <p>But if neither the Conſideration of theſe things, nor of any thing elſe can deter them from doing what is intended they ſhall, nor from dividing the Body and the Intereſt of the <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liſh</hi> Reformation.</p>
            <p>All the harm I wiſh is, that they do not at the long run bring that both upon themſelves and others which they are at preſent ſo much concerned to avoid. — So hoping that this account of theſe Two Worthies may be no ways offenſive to Government</p>
